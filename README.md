# CryptoTrends
### As part of FullStack Academy's 'Stackathon', CryptoTrends was an entry created in 4 days.

An expansive take on cryptocurrency marketplace data, CryptoTrends is a web application that combines aggregated market data with data from both Twitter and Google Trends API's. Users can explore different time frames and toggle different data types to gain insights into the correlation between coin prices and social media trends.

NOTE: CryptoTrends has forked, deleting the collection of TOTAL tweets portion. This is due to Twitter's limited API access. Instead, users can search for individual Twitter handles to view when tweets were made.


### FINISHED UPDATES OF V2
* Resolved google-trends-api library issues
* Users can search for individual Twitter users and see when they tweeted in the data timeline
